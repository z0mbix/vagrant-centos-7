vagrant-centos-7
================

A basic CentOS 7.x vagrant VM

I'm forever spinning up new VMs which all need some setting up with basic dev tools

Basebox from the lovely people at Chef: [https://github.com/opscode/bento](https://github.com/opscode/bento)

If you want to have a good time, install [vagrant-vbguest](https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest):

	$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest

Then:

	$ vagrant up
